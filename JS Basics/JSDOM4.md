f# JavaScript Promises and Async/Await

This code demonstrates the use of Promises and async/await in JavaScript. It includes examples of creating and using promises, chaining promises, and using async/await to simplify asynchronous code.

## Promises

A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It provides a way to handle the result of an asynchronous operation without blocking the main thread of execution.

In the code, we create a promise using the `new Promise` syntax. The promise takes a function as an argument, which is called the executor function. The executor function takes two arguments, `resolve` and `reject`. The `resolve` function is called when the asynchronous operation is successful, and the `reject` function is called when the asynchronous operation fails.

For example, the following code creates a promise that resolves to the value 2233 after 5 seconds:

```javascript
let meraPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("I'm inside Promise 1");
  }, 5000);
  resolve(2233);
});
```

We can then use the `then` method to handle the result of the promise. The `then` method takes two functions as arguments, a success handler and an error handler. The success handler is called when the promise resolves, and the error handler is called when the promise rejects.

For example, the following code uses the `then` method to log the value 2233 to the console:

```javascript
meraPromise.then(
  (value) => {
    console.log(value);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("Recieved an error");
  }
);
```

## Chaining Promises

Promises can be chained together to create a sequence of asynchronous operations. Each promise in the chain depends on the previous promise, and the result of each promise is passed to the next promise in the chain.

For example, the following code creates a chain of two promises. The first promise resolves to the value `true` after 2 seconds, and the second promise resolves to the value `"Waadaa2 resolved"` after 3 seconds:

```javascript
let waadaa1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("setTimeout1
